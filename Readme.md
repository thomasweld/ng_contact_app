## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate an understanding of AngularJS $scope, Controllers, Models & ViewModels
- Understand how to manage data stored on a server
- Understand how to set up a front end router using UI Router

## Normal Mode

- Using the images below as a template/guide - build a simple contact list
- On your "home" view, show a list of all of the users in your database.
- When I click on any of the users, I'm routed to a view with that user's info.
- There should be a back button or icon to take me back to the home (list) view.
- The URL should also change to reflect the current resource I'm viewing.
- There needs to be a third "add" view, where you see a contact form and can add a new contact
- After you add a new contact, I should be routed back to the home "list" page
- All of your data should be stored on the class server for now
